# The code that makes a developer a good one is a code with these
# characteristics:
# 1 - cleanliness - well formatted
# 2 - readability - a code that tells a story, for instance, using the most
# friendly naming for variables possible.
# 3 - predictability - a code that values simplicity over cleverness for
# improving understanding. Not trying to use the newest untested features or
# obscure tools
# 4 - DRY - "Do not Repeat Yourself". Don't copy-paste lines of code, instead
# if some lines of code are required to be repeated, turn 'em into a functions
